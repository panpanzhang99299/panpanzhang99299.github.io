This is a R package for weighted and directed network analysis. The package is publicly available on the [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wdnet/index.html). This 
package was selected as one of the "honorable mentions" for the [**John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award**](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/awards/john-m-chambers)
(ASA Section on Statistical Computing) in 2023.
