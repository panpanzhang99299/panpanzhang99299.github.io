My research interest lies at the interface of applied probability, applied statistics and machine learning. My research is driven by collaborations with many extremely brilliant and outstanding probabilists/statisticians/biostatisticians/computer scientists.

Network Analysis
====================
I am particularly interested in the following topics:
* Neuroimaging and social science applications
* Network data analysis (e.g., **community detection** and **link prediction**)
* Random network models (e.g., **degree distribution** and **topological measures**)

Longitudinal Data Analysis
====================
I am committed to developing novel statistical methods for assessing dementia risk in neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders. Specifically, my work addresses challenges arising from **missing data** and **measurement error**, with a particular focus on applications to Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and other neurodegenerative disorders.

Causal Inference
====================
I establish analytical frameworks to enhance understanding of how molecular signatures (e.g., proteomic profiles) influence cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease and aging populations. These frameworks integrate pathway-level analyses and are specifically designed to address statistical challenges associated with **high dimensionality**.

Collaborative Research
====================
I have engaged in a variety of research projects, in collaboration with the faculty members, trainees and medical professionals from

*Vanderbilt University Medical Center*
* Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center ([VMAC](https://www.vumc.org/vmac/home))
* Medical-Image Analysis and Statistical Interpretation ([MASI](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/masi/)) Lab

*Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania*
* Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research ([CNDR](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cndr/))
* Penn Frontotemporal Degeneration Center ([Penn FTD Center](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ftd/))
