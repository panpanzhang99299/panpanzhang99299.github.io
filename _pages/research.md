My research interest lies at the interface of applied probability, applied statistics and machine learning. My research is driven by collaborations with a few extremely talented and outstanding probabilists/statisticians/biostatisticians/computer scientists.

Network Analysis
====================
This is a broad and burgeoning research topic. Specifically, I am interested in
* Neuroimaging applications
* Network data analysis (community detection, link prediction, etc.)
* Random network models (degree distribution, topological indices, etc.)

Longitudinal Data Analysis
====================
This is the primary focus of my current reserch. We are committed to developing novel statistical methods for assessing dementia risk in neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders. Specifically, we investigate missing data, measurement error and variable selection problems, and focus on the applications to Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.  

Collaborative Research
====================
I have engaged in a variety of research projects, in collaboration with the faculty members and medical professionals from

*Vanderbilt University Medical Center*
* Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center ([VMAC](https://www.vumc.org/vmac/home))

*Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania*
* Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research ([CNDR](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cndr/))
* Penn Frontotemporal Degeneration Center ([Penn FTD Center](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ftd/))
* Penn Memory Center ([PMC](https://pennmemorycenter.org/))
