My research interest lies at the interface of applied probability, applied statistics and machine learning. My research is driven by collaborations with many extremely brilliant and outstanding probabilists/statisticians/biostatisticians/computer scientists.

Network Analysis
====================
This is a broad and burgeoning research topic. I am particularly interested in
* Neuroimaging and social science applications
* Network data analysis (community detection, link prediction, etc.)
* Random network models (degree distribution, topological indices, etc.)

Longitudinal Data Analysis
====================
This is the primary focus of my current research. We are committed to developing novel statistical methods for assessing dementia risk in neurodegenerative diseases and related disorders. Specifically, we investigate **missing data**, **measurement error** and **high dimension** problems with focus on the applications to Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease and other neurodegenerative disorders.  

Collaborative Research
====================
I have engaged in a variety of research projects, in collaboration with the faculty members, trainees and medical professionals from

*Vanderbilt University Medical Center*
* Vanderbilt Memory & Alzheimer's Center ([VMAC](https://www.vumc.org/vmac/home))
* Medical-Image Analysis and Statistical Interpretation Lab ([MASI](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/masi/))

*Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania*
* Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research ([CNDR](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cndr/))
* Penn Frontotemporal Degeneration Center ([Penn FTD Center](https://www.med.upenn.edu/ftd/))
* Penn Memory Center ([PMC](https://pennmemorycenter.org/))
