excerpt: 'This study investigates whether mild kidney dysfunction alters the performance of blood-based Alzheimer’s disease (AD) biomarkers. Because plasma biomarkers are increasingly used for early 
          detection and risk prediction, we examined how estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a marker of kidney function, affects the accuracy of several AD-related plasma measures. We found that 
          even modest reductions in kidney function significantly diminished the predictive accuracy of these biomarkers for detecting AD pathology. The results indicate that kidney dysfunction can confound 
          biomarker concentrations and should be considered when interpreting plasma-based AD tests, emphasizing the need to account for renal health in both clinical and research applications.. <[**DOI**](https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70651) \| [**PubMed**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40970383/)>'

Introduction
===
The impact of chronic kidney disease (CKD) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) plasma biomarkers is poorly understood. We tested whether kidney function decline affects the predictive accuracy of plasma biomarkers on 
neuropsychological or neuroimaging outcomes.

Methods
===
Three hundred thirty-three non-demented older adults were included. Linear regressions related plasma glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light chain (NfL), amyloid beta 42, and phosphorylated tau231,
with a blood-based biomarker $\times$ estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) interaction term, to cross-sectional and longitudinal (mean follow-up time = 6.4 $\pm$ 2.8 years) neuropsychological and neuroimaging 
outcomes.

Results
===
Plasma NfL interacted with eGFR on the longitudinal trajectory of nearly all neuropsychological outcomes (p values < 0.02) and several neuroimaging outcomes (p values < 0.02). Associations were stronger in individuals 
with no CKD/stage 1 and stage 2 CKD, while associations were weaker or not significant in individuals with stage 3 CKD.

Discussion
===
Among older adults free of severe CKD, the ability of plasma NfL to predict key AD-related biomarker outcomes was moderated by renal function.

Highlights
===
- Reduced kidney function was associated with increased blood biomarker levels.
- The predictive accuracy of neurofilament light chain was reduced in participants with kidney dysfunction.
- Even mild kidney dysfunction can affect blood biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease.
