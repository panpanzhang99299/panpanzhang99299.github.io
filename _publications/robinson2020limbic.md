excerpt: 'TAR-DNA binding protein-43 (TDP-43) proteinopathy has been seen in multiple brain diseases. In this paper, we combined both cases and neuropathologists’ diagnoses from two research centres---University of Pennsylvania and University of Kentucky. The study was designed to compare neuropathological findings between frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) and limbic-predominant, age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE).'
