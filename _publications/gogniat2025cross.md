excerpt: "In this paper, WE examined both cross-sectional and longitudinal links between baseline neighborhood disadvantage, quantified by the Area Deprivation Index (ADI), 
        and fluid biomarkers of neuroinflammation and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology over up to nine years of follow-up using the Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project cohort. 
        At baseline, greater neighborhood disadvantage was significantly associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid levels of chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), a marker of neuroinflammation, 
        and elevated total tau. Longitudinally, higher ADI was linked to faster annual increases in plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific systemic inflammation marker, 
        after adjusting for key covariates. The findings support the idea that living in socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhoods may contribute to systemic inflammation and early 
        AD-related neurodegenerative processes, suggesting a sociobiologic pathway underlying health disparities in aging. <[**DOI**](https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.000000000021377) \| [**PubMed**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40561381)>"

Background: 
===
Living in a socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood has an adverse impact on health outcomes, including increased risk of Alzheimer disease (AD). 
The biological mechanisms underlying this risk are poorly understood. We sought to examine how neighborhood disadvantage relates to core AD pathology, 
neurodegeneration, and inflammatory biomarkers in community-dwelling older adults cross-sectionally and over time.

Methods: 
===
Participants included older adults from the Vanderbilt Memory and Aging Project who underwent fasting blood and CSF acquisition serially over a 9-year follow-up 
period (mean follow-up = $6.4$ years (blood) and $4.0$ years (CSF)). Area Deprivation Index (ADI), representing neighborhood disadvantage, was quantified at 
baseline using 17 components (e.g., housing, income, education, and household characteristics), with higher values indicating greater disadvantage. Ordinary 
least-squares regressions cross-sectionally related ADI to plasma and CSF inflammatory biomarkers adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, modified 
Framingham Stroke Risk Profile score, APOE $\varepsilon$4 status, and cognitive status. Linear mixed-effects regression models related ADI to longitudinal 
biomarkers with identical covariates plus follow-up time. Outcomes included CSF chitinase-3-like protein 1 (YKL-40), CSF soluble-triggering receptor expressed 
on myeloid cells 2, CSF amyloid-$\beta$42 (A$\beta$42), CSF A$\beta$40/A$\beta$42 ratio, CSF tau, CSF phosphorylated tau (ptau), plasma high-sensitivity 
C-reactive protein (CRP), and plasma and CSF neurofilament light chain. 

Results: 
===
Participants ($n = 334$; $73 \pm 8$ years old, 59% male, 86% White, non-Hispanic) on average were from relatively less disadvantaged neighborhoods (ADI national 
decile = $33 \pm 25$, range = 1--98). Greater neighborhood disadvantage at study entry was cross-sectionally associated with elevated CSF YKL-40 ($\beta$ = 0.7, 
p = 0.003) and tau ($\beta$ = 1.8, p = 0.04) after excluding outliers. Greater neighborhood disadvantage at study entry related to faster longitudinal increases 
in plasma CRP ($\beta$ = 0.005, p = 0.03).

Conclusion: 
===
Greater neighborhood disadvantage was associated with elevated inflammatory and AD CSF biomarkers cross-sectionally and longitudinal increases in a nonspecific 
inflammatory blood biomarker. Findings suggest that neighborhood disadvantage confers risk of systemic inflammation and AD pathology, providing a possible 
sociobiological mechanism underlying health disparities in aging adults; however, results were limited by use of ADI at study entry.
