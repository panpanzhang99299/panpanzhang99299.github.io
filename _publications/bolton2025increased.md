excerpt: 'The study investigates whether elevated neuroplastic activity, measured by CSF GAP-43, is involved early in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis. In 161 non-demented older adults followed for four years (in average), 
          higher baseline GAP-43 was strongly associated with core AD biomarkers (lower Aβ42/40 ratio and higher p-tau and total tau) and predicted further amyloid decline over time. These associations were stronger 
          in individuals with AD risk factors such as APOE ε4, cerebrovascular risk, female sex, and MCI. The findings suggest that heightened neuroplastic activity may not simply reflect compensatory responses but 
          may actively contribute to early AD pathology. <[**DOI**](https://doi.org/10.1002/alz.70897) \| [**PubMed**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/41315049/)>'

Introduction
===
We test the hypothesis that high levels of neuroplasticity in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors are involved in AD pathogenesis by investigating interactions between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of 
growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) and AD risk factors (female sex, cerebrovascular risk, mild cognitive impairment, apolipoprotein E [APOE] $\varepsilon$4 genotype, amyloid positivity) on CSF biomarkers of AD pathology 
(amyloid beta 42/40[A$\beta$42/40], phosphorylated tau (p-tau)) and neurodegeneration (tau).

Methods
===
Baseline GAP-43 levels in 161 non-demented older adults were related to cross-sectional and longitudinal (mean follow-up = 4 years) CSF biomarkers of AD, adjusting for covariates, with GAP-43 $\times$ AD risk factor 
interaction terms.

Results
===
Higher GAP-43 was cross-sectionally related to all AD biomarkers (p-values < 0.0001) and predicted longitudinal reductions in A$\beta$42 (p < 0.0001). Associations were stronger in AD risk groups.

Discussion
===
We found strong support linking increased levels of neuroplasticity in the context of AD risk factors to the pathological cascade of AD over a 4-year mean follow-up period.

Highlights
===
- Cerebrospinal fluid growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43) is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarkers cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
- GAP-43 interacts with AD risk factors to predict AD biomarkers.
- Increased neuroplastic activity may play a role in AD pathogenesis.
