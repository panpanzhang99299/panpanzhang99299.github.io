title: "Appropriateness of applying cerebrospinal fluid biomarker cutoffs from Alzheimer's disease to Parkinson's disease"

excerpt: "We evaluated whether cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker cutoffs established for Alzheimer's disease (AD), specifically amyloid-ß 1-42 (Aß42), total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and the ratios t-tau/Aß42 and p-tau/Aß42, are appropriate when applied to Parkinson's Disease (PD) patients using the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative cohort. Amyloid PET imaging and longitudinal cognitive outcomes were used as reference standards. We found that the optimal Aß42 cutoff in the PD cohort was higher than the AD-derived value, while the cutoffs for t-tau/Aß42 and p-tau/Aß42 were significantly lower than in AD, with non-overlapping confidence intervals. Similarly, optimal thresholds for t-tau and p-tau to predict cognitive decline in PD were significantly lower than AD cutoffs. The results suggest that AD-based CSF biomarker thresholds may not generalize to PD populations, likely reflecting the impact of disease-specific pathologies such as alpha-synuclein in shaping biomarker distributions."
