excerpt: 'In this paper, we assessed the suitability and diagnostic accuracy of established cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker cutoffs for Alzheimer disease (AD) in the Parkinson disease (PD) population. Specifically, we considered amyloid-ß 1-42 (Aß 1-42), total tau (t-tau), phosphorylated tau (p-tau), the ratio of t-tau and Aß 1-42, and the ratio of p-tau and Aß 1-42."

Background: 
===
While cutoffs for abnormal levels of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers amyloid-$\beta$ 1-42 (A$\beta$142), total tau (t-tau), 
phosphorylated tau (p-tau), and the ratios of t-tau/A$\beta$142 and p-tau/A$\beta$142, have been established in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), 
biologically relevant cutoffs have not been studied extensively in Parkinson’s disease (PD). 

Objective: 
===
Assess the suitability and diagnostic accuracy of established AD-derived CSF biomarker cutoffs in the PD 
population. 

Methods: 
===
Baseline and longitudinal data on CSF biomarkers, cognitive diagnoses, and PET amyloid imaging in 423 newly diagnosed patients with PD 
from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) cohort were used to evaluate established AD biomarker cutoffs compared with 
optimal cutoffs derived from the PPMI cohort. 

Results: 
===
Using PET amyloid imaging as the gold standard for AD pathology, the optimal cutoff of A$\beta$142 was higher than the AD cutoff, the optimal 
cutoffs of t-tau/A$\beta$142 and p-tau/A$\beta$142 were lower than the AD cutoffs, and their confidence intervals (CIs) did not overlap with the AD cutoffs. 
Optimal cutoffs for t-tau and p-tau to predict cognitive impairment were significantly lower than the AD cutoffs, and their CIs did not 
overlap with the AD cutoffs. 

Conclusion: 
===
Optimal cutoffs for the PPMI cohort for A$\beta$142, t-tau/A$\beta$142, and p-tau/A$\beta$142 to predict amyloid-PET positivity and for t-tau and p-tau to 
predict cognitive impairment differ significantly from cutoffs derived from AD populations. The presence of additional pathologies such as 
alpha-synuclein in PD may lead to disease-specific CSF biomarker characteristics.
